Welcome! I am a political scientist and public policy scholar studying political behavior and American political institutions. My dissertation applies causal inference and computational methods to understand how contact with criminal-legal institutions affects political behavior. 
 
I am a Ph.D. candidate in government at Cornell University. My research has been published in the British Journal of Criminology, the Journal of Criminal Justice, the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, and it under review at other outlets. I am a Graduate Research Fellow with the National Science Foundation and was previously a Mitofsky and Kohut fellow at the Roper Center for Public Opinion. My work has also been generously funded by a variety of other sources including the American Political Science Associationâ€™s Centennial Grant, the PRICE institute (at Cornell), and the Population Center (at Cornell).
